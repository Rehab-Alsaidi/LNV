This methodology outlines the pipeline for liver tumor detection and characterization, combining deep learning with feature-based analysis for optimal nanoparticle design.

1. **YOLOv8 Object Detection**:
   - **YOLOv8** is used to localize liver tumors in MRI images. This model is known for its speed and accuracy, detecting the presence and location of tumors and marking them with bounding boxes.

2. **Crop the Tumor Region**:
   - After detecting the tumor, we crop the tumor region from the MRI image for focused analysis, reducing irrelevant data and improving model performance.

3. **Segment Tumor Shape**:
   - A binary mask is created by applying thresholding techniques to the tumor region, allowing clear delineation between the tumor and surrounding tissue. This step isolates the tumor's boundaries for further analysis.

4. **Extract Tumor Features**:
   - Several features are extracted from the segmented tumor region, including:
     - **Bounding Box Dimensions**: Position and size of the bounding box around the tumor.
     - **Aspect Ratio**: Ratio of width to height of the tumor.
     - **Perimeter**: Total boundary length of the tumor.
     - **Area**: Number of pixels within the tumor region.
     - **Major and Minor Axes**: The longest and shortest diameters of the tumor, respectively.
   - These features are key to understanding the tumor's geometry and are used for nanoparticle design.

5. **Connect Tumor Features to Nanoparticle Design**:
   - Tumor features, such as diameter and aspect ratio, are used to determine the optimal nanoparticle size for targeted drug delivery. A set of rules is applied, derived from studies on drug release from vasculature-bound nanoparticles.

| 517                                     | 352                     | 404                          |
| 675                                     | 382                     | 322                          |
| 760                                     | 334                     | 288                          |
